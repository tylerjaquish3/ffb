# Questions
I just have 5 quick survey questions for you relating to our fantasy football league that's about to start its 19th season.

1. On a scale from 1-10, how excited are you for fantasy football season approaching?
    - Why did you pick that number?
2. How many championships would you say "XXXX" has won?
    - Why do you think he hasn't won more?
3. If you could pick a draft position for "XXXX" what would you pick?
    - Do you think he would want that position or are you sabotaging him?
4. This may be a shot in the dark, how many points do you think "XXXX" scored last year?
5. In a few weeks, we're going to vote on a new punishment for the league loser. Do you have any ideas?

That's it. Thank you so much for participating. And please keep this confidential from "XXXX" until I share the results with him, I would appreciate it.
