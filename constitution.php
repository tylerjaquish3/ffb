                                <p>We, the members of Suntown Fantasy Football League, in order to promote and encourage interest in Fantasy Football,
                                    do ordain and establish this Constitution for the government of our association, including the heathens that do not hail from Sunnyside, WA.
                                </p>

                                <p>The Suntown Fantasy Football league began many moons ago, as a group of college students that enjoyed watching football together.
                                    The ten league members, as they stand today, began competing in 2008. However, the coveted league trophy dates back to 2006, where
                                    the league only contained eight members. The data on this website dates back to 2006 to correlate with the league trophy.</p>

                                <p>This league will always be a free, head-to-head league hosted by Yahoo. The only prize is a plaque with the champion's name inscribed that gets added to the league trophy,
                                    as well as the trophy living with the champion until a new champion is crowned. The league has also voted that the 10th place finisher
                                    must pay for the new plaque at the end of each season, sit on a toilet during the next draft, and their team name (for the following season) shall be set by the champion.</p>

                                <p>The league matchups schedule shall use data from prior seasons to determine the optimal weekly schedules for each manager to face opponents as equally as possible.
                                    Since this has been enacted relatively recently, the data is skewed and may take several seasons to even out the schedules.
                                </p>

                                <p>All parts of this constitution, including rules and practices, may be modified or amended with a majority vote. However, if deemed minor, changes may be made by the commissioner without
                                    whining or complaining by the members. Questions concerning the interpretation of this document shall be reviewed and <u>swiftly</u> deleted by the commissioner.</p>

                                <p>The fantasy football draft is the single most important day of the fantasy football season, but the league is not won at the draft.
                                Our draft is held on or around the end of August, generally one week before the kickoff of the NFL season.</p>

                                <p>Approximately 6 weeks before the draft, the draft order is determined in a unique but random fashion. This is created by the commissioner
                                and recorded for video evidence, with no retakes or edits in order to preserve authenticity and integrity. For instance, when the dog ran
                                away with the tennis ball with Gavin's name on it, the video continued uncut. The draft order will always be determined with complete randomness,
                                giving every manager an equal chance at getting the #1 pick.</p>

                                <p>The draft shall always be of "snake" orientation and draft grades given by Yahoo shall always be considered 100% accurate and reliable.</p>

                                FAB info:<br />
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In a Free Agents Budgets (FAB) waivers system, each manager receives a dollar amount to place blind offers on waived players throughout the season. 
                                        The manager with the highest offer at the end of the waiver period claims that player, and that offer amount is deducted from the team's free agent budget for the season. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If multiple managers place an equal offer on a player, tiebreaker goes by reverse order of standings.</li>
                                    <li>The FAB system charges you the exact amount you bid if your bid is successful. It will never automatically adjust your bid to beat any other bids by $1.</li>
                                    <li>Each manager starts the season with a $200 budget.</li>
                                    <li>FAB does not apply to free-agent pickups. All free agents can be picked up on a first-come, first-served basis, without bids. Just like before, players become free agents after the waiver period ends.</li>
                                    <li>Minimum bid is $0.</li>
                                    <li>Just like before, you can update/change/cancel your bid on a player on your team page before they process.</li>
                                    <li>Waiver deadlines and periods remain the same (Game time - Tuesday).</li>
                                </ul>
