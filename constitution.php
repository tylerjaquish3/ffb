                                <p>We, the members of Suntown Fantasy Football League, in order to promote and encourage interest in Fantasy Football,
                                    do ordain and establish this Constitution for the government of our association, including the heathens that do not hail from Sunnyside, WA.
                                </p>

                                <p>The Suntown Fantasy Football league began many moons ago, as a group of college students that enjoyed watching football together.
                                    The ten league members, as they stand today, began competing in 2008. However, the coveted league trophy dates back to 2006, where
                                    the league only contained eight members. The data on this website dates back to 2006 to correlate with the league trophy.</p>

                                <p>This league will always be a free, head-to-head league hosted by Yahoo. The only prize is a plaque with the champion's name inscribed that gets added to the league trophy,
                                    as well as the trophy living with the champion until a new champion is crowned. The league has also voted that the 10th place finisher
                                    must pay for the new plaque at the end of each season.</p>

                                <p>The league matchups schedule shall use data from prior seasons to determine the optimal weekly schedules for each manager to face opponents as equally as possible.
                                    Since this has been enacted relatively recently, the data is skewed and may take several seasons to even out the schedules.
                                </p>

                                <p>All parts of this constitution, including rules and practices, may be modified or ammended with a majority vote. However, if deemed minor, changes may be made by the commissioner without
                                    whining or complaining by the members. Questions concerning the interpretation of this document shall be reviewed and <u>swiftly</u> deleted by the commissioner.</p>

                                <p>The fantasy football draft is the single most important day of the fantasy football season, but the league is not won at the draft.
                                Our draft is held on or around the end of August, generally one week before the kickoff of the NFL season.</p>

                                <p>Approximately 6 weeks before the draft, the draft order is determined in a unique but random fashion. This is created by the commissioner
                                and recorded for video evidence, with no retakes or edits in order to preserve authenticity and integrity. For instance, when the dog ran
                                away with the tennis ball with Gavin's name on it, the video continued uncut. The draft order will always be determined with complete randomness,
                                giving every manager an equal chance at getting the #1 pick.</p>

                                <p>The draft shall always be of "snake" orientation and draft grades given by Yahoo shall always be considered 100% accurate and reliable.</p>

                                        for the current week is to be accepted by Thursday. If any trade elements play on Thursday, the deadline for the trade to be accepted is Monday.
