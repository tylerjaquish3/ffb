- Schedules are the same as last year, so Gavin again faces the league's 
    easiest schedule (not having to play against himself)
- Week 1 features a rematch from last year's championship and the 4th year in a row they have faced each other in week 1.
- Andy has won 7 of 8 against Justin over last 5 seasons
- Matt and AJ are tied with 15 wins against each other. Matt has scored the most points in his career against AJ (5942).

2024 Recap
- Gavin comes off a season where he led the league in lineup accuracy, scoring 93% of his optimal points.
    Which is easier to do when he leads the league with total TDs, 
    and scored 14 more rushing TDs (45 total) than the next best (Everett with 31)
- Cole made it to the Final as the 6 seed (7-7 record) after starting the year in last place
- Matt & Justin faced off in the Toilet Bowl after both finishing 3-11 thanks in part to Anthony Richardson and Dak Prescott.
- Cam won his third championship a year after finishing in last place while also making the fewest moves he's made since 2016.
- 2024 gave us the biggest gap in most wins (11) and fewest wins (3) since 2019. And it was the first time we've seen 2 managers have 11 wins
