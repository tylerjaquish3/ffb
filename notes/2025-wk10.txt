recap
- Everett took the most PA battle from Tyler so he would stop complaining about it
- Ben missed his optimal lineup by only .1 pts in week 9. only Andy has set an optimal lineup so far (week 3), 
    whereas last year the league did it 12 times
- Gavin was second in total yards and second in total TDs last week and lost
- 580 passing yards has only happened 8 times all season and 3 of them were in week 9. 
    Gavin (661), Everett (626), and Matt (580) did it, but Andy still leads with 706 in week 7.
- This is only the second time in the last 10 years that we've had two teams at 7-2 or better by week 10. we've only seen it 4 times in 20 years.
    This is Cole's best record ever at week 10 (7-2). 8 of the 18 weeks he's spent in 1st place have been this season.
