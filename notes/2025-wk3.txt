Recap
- Cole had 5 receiving TDs in week 2, more than Everett, AJ, and Justin have combined over 2 weeks.
- Only two managers changed position in the standings from week 1 to 2 (Cam & Tyler switched)
- This is only Cam's 2nd time in 20 years to start 0-2. Last time was 2022 and he ended up 10-4 that season, so watch out.
- AJ is once again taking flight with WR stats, already racking up 87 receptions when everyone else is between 49-57

Preview
- Everett & Andy are the only 2 managers that still have all the players they drafted (at the time of this writing), 
    and now those two go head to head for the first time since they faced off for the 7th-8th matchup last season.
- Ben has the highest week 3 score since we shrank the rosters (last 5 years) at 195.7 points,
    and he gets to face Cole whom he's beaten 7 out of their last 10 matchups. These two are #1 and #2 in Points Against all-time,
    but they are bucking that trend this season.
- The league's regular season #1 matches up with the postseason #1 where Cam has won 4 of the last 5 against Justin, one of which was  the closest margin in their 25 matchup history (1.94 points).
