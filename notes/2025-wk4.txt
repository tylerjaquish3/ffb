Recap
- Cameron has more interceptions than Gavin, Justin, Cole, and Matt combined
- Gavin has really good run defense and Cole has really good pass defense. 
    their opponents have stunk it up for 2 of their 3 matchups so far
- Andy is the first manager to set a perfect lineup this season (scoring his optimal points by benching the right players).
    two of the top 3 lineup setters were playing Cameron (Cole wk 1 and Justin wk 3).
- Round 2 is the only draft round where all players drafted have been in our lineups for all 3 weeks.
- AJ has the second most bench points through 3 weeks that we've ever seen. Gavin set the bar with 250 to start 2016 and AJ has 244.

Preview
- Justin has beaten AJ in 9 straight (2 of those were championships). AJ was also 3-0 last year until Justin beat him in week 4.
    AJ hasn't beaten justin since Trevor Lawrence and Mac Jones were drafted (they play each other on sunday)
- Everett has the highest percentage of his wins against Ben (15%) but he looks up to him in the standings.
    they are the only 2 managers that haven't spent any of their FAB money.
- Matt has won 9 of the last 12 against Cole with one of those being his closest win ever (.26 margin)
    they have only played once when Cole was in first place and Matt won that too.
