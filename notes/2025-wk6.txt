    the high on the year was Ben in week 3 with 387, 6x more than Ev had last week.
- Matt's 155 points last week were his highest score since week 11 2023, thanks in part to his total yards. 
    Week 4 he had 1156 total yards and week 5 he had 1157. so guess what's coming?

- Cole dropped out of 1st place for the first time this season and AJ is in 1st place for the first time since week 4 of last year.
