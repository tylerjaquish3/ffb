recap
- last week we saw the 2nd lowest league margin of all time. the 5 matchups of the week had an average margin of 10.7 points, 
    the only closer week was week 2 of 2020 where the average margin was 8.4. 
    four of the top eight closest matchups of the year happened in week 6.
- last week we also saw the lowest margin from the high score to low score in league history. just 31 points separated
    the top score from the bottom score. the next highest ever recorded was 38 points in 2021. the average range is 89 points
- Matt joined the 11 TD club as the 6th manager to record 11 touchdowns in a week.
- AJ set a new season high for passing yards in a week with 605, passing Cole's 604 yards in week 1. 
    Gavin had 1 passing TD for the 3rd time, while he's the only manager that has done that more than once.
- ultimate luck for Cole last week, as he was #9 in scoring on the week and won.
- Tyler is 3-3 for the 3rd year in a row, setting the bar for mediocrity.

preview
- all 3 of Tyler's wins have come at a margin under 8 points. his avg margin of victory is 5.3 points. now he faces Cole, 
    who's knocked him out of the playoffs the last 2 seasons, while Tyler won both regular season matchups, both in week 7.
    he'll do so without his Bills, who've accounted for 26% of all Cole's season points.
- Gavin has beaten Justin in 7 of the last 9 matchups. they haven't had a close matchup since 2018, with an average margin of 49 points.
    Gavin's 660 points is the lowest in league history through 6 weeks, and he's on pace to score just 1540. the lowest season ever was 1621 (Ben in 2020 and that was with 1 fewer week in the schedule).
- Andy's closest ever loss to Matt came when these two matched up in week 7 of last year (6.5 margin). this will be the second
    time in 3 years that they've faced each other with identical records, but last time it was week 14 and decided a playoff spot (for Matt).
- Everett's worst winning % is against AJ (38%). they have the top 2 benches in the league this season. 
    ironically, Everett's worst lineup accuracy (73% in week 1) this season resulted in his only win so far.
- Cam has won 10 out of the last 13 against Ben, including last year's semifinal. but only 1 of those wins came when Cam was lower in the standings like he is now.
