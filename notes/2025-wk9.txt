recap
- oh cool, the guys with the most championships are at the top of the standings. (sarcasm)
- after Andy set a new season high with 6 rushing TDs and 380 rushing yards in week 7, 
    Cole went and one upped him with 6 TDS and 389 yards in week 8.
- AJ is the only manager who hasn't had a week without an interception and Everett is the only manager who hasn't had
    a week without a rushing TD
- AJ's receiving yards have decreased every week since week 4 (463,433,345,324,316).
- Matt had more interceptions (3) than total touchdowns (2) in week 8, setting a new low for touchdowns in a week 
    (both were receiving TDs). And he won.
- Of all the lowest weekly receiving totals in a week, the top 3 were against Cole when he faced 
    Ben (126), Cam (133), and Tyler (154).
- Justin's 4th round pick (Jonathon Taylor) has scored more points than Tyler, Gavin, and Matt's 1st round picks combined.

preview
- the last of the matchups before we run it back
- Before Matt beat Justin week 9 of last year, Justin had won their last 8 matchups (2 postseason) and 16-2 dating back to 2014.
    this doesnt include their Toilet Bowl matchup last year, where Justin handed Matt a 91-point beatdown.
- Tyler & Ev face off as the top 2 in points against. In fact, they each have only faced one opponent all season that 
    finished in the bottom half of scoring on the week (both were against Gavin).
- Cole & Andy have been trading blows since 2019. Cole has more total points in their 26 matchups, but Andy has more wins (14-12)
- Cam & AJ come into week 9 having some of the best week 9 records of all time. Cam at 12-5 and AJ at 12-7. 
    when they faced last year, Cam outscored AJ at every roster position except Bench, winning by 86 pts
- 3 of the last 5 times that Gavin has beaten Ben were as the underdog
