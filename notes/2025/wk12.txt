recap
- Cole is the first playoff clincher with 9 wins. he has only gotten to 9 wins one other time (2017 when he won it all).
    he usually only has 6 or 7 (67!) wins.
- the bottom 3 in the standings haven't moved since week 4. that's 8 weeks of not moving, something we have never seen in the league.
    the closest to it was in 2011, the bottom 3 didnt move for the final 5 weeks of the season.
- Aj's 2.34 margin win was the 2nd slimmest of the season and Ben's 5.52 margin was the 5th slimmest.
- Tyler set a new season high for passing yards with 733, thanks in part to Brissett's NFL record 47 completions. 
    he also has the lowest passing yards in week 4 (203 yards).
- no team had thrown more than 3 interceptions in a week until AJ and Matt both threw 4 in week 11
- Gavin now has the week with the most TDs (13 in wk 7) and fewest TDs (2 in wk 11)
- Everett is the only manager that has had at least 1 rushing TD every week (but he has 7 weeks with only 1).
