recap
- what's worse? not setting your optimal lineup and losing or setting your optimal lineup and it still not being enough to win? askng for my friend Justin.
- Matt pulled off the season sweep against Cole and dealt him 2 of his 3 losses this season. the last thing Cole wants to see in the playoffs is Matt.
    even though Cole lost, he still hasn't faced a top 7 scorer on the week since his last loss in week 5. 
    so not only does he average the highest weekly rank (4.00) but he also faces the worst opponent avg weekly rank (7.77)
- this was the first time all season Ben, Justin and Cole lost in the same week, they must be colluding (but i'm not sure how)
- Justin scored his lowest of the season after stuffing himself with gravy instead of setting his lineup
- Cam squeaked out the closest win of the season (1.54 margin) thanks to Andy outlasting Jaxson. both players needed a bye after all that stress.


preview
Ben vs Andy - Andy has double the points from his first 5 picks (1303 vs 667) and 4 times as many from rounds 10-17 (680 vs 138).
    but ben is playing for his fantasy life this weekend. he needs a win plus a loss from either Matt or Tyler
Tyler vs Cam - Cam averages his highest against Tyler (180) but unfortunately, the highest points against him is also Tyler (183).
    Tyler set the high for the season last year in week 14 (211 pts).
Matt vs Everett - everett still has a league high 13 of his drafted players. as many as Matt & Tyler combined.
    if Matt wins, he's in the playoffs. but he can also get in if he loses based on what happens above
Gavin vs AJ - highest optimal all season was AJ in week 5 (209). biggest blowout of the season was these 2 in week 5 (87 margin)
    these two lead the league in points missed from their optimal (327 & 285). gavin is in danger of having his lowest PF of all time. 
    he's at 1571 and his lowest ever was 1762, so he only needs 192 this week even though he's averaging 120.
Justin vs Cole - Cole is 4-0 all time in week 14. they both don't have much to play for this weekend. 
    Cole has locked in a bye next week, and Justin will be the 3 or 4 seed. Cole has
