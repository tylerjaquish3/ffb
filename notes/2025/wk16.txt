recap
- Kyle Pitts would have outscored all TEs all-time in our league (40 pts), but since Cole didn't have a matchup, his stats won't be saved anywhere.
    - next highest was 38 from Darren Waller in 2020.
- likewise, Cole had 15 TDs last week whereas no one all season has had more than 13, but again, they don't count.
- we/Matt added nearly 400 days to the counter on <a href="http://justindidiersucks.club">Justin Didier Sucks Club</a>
- Tyler's 100 point victory was the 2nd highest playoff victory ever. Everett won by 159 in the 2006 Quarterfinal against Cole.
- Every player on his team scored a TD except his TE.

    - of the 12 times Ben has been in this position before, he has only won 3 of them.
