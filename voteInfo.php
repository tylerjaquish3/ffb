                            In order to make the draft more even, it is proposed to add an 18th roster position so there are 18 rounds in the draft. This would
                            prevent the first pick in the first round from also having the first pick in the last round.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The other question would be what position to add. The two options are an additional Bench position or an additional W/R/T position.
                            Both proposals would make the free agent pool smaller. Adding a bench spot would allow managers to hold more players, so navigating
                            bye weeks would be easier. Adding a W/R/T position would make the flex position more valuable and would allow managers to start more
                            RBs or WRs (most likely), but it would make it harder than it is now to fill your roster with only 6 bench spots.

                            We have never seen collusion in our league, and it doesn't seem like it will ever happen - everyone wants to win badly (although Gavin's track record
                            doesn't show it) and there is no prize to share.<br /><br />
                            So the question is, why would the league veto a trade? Every accepted trade is between two consenting adults (insert sexual joke here) that are
                            attempting to improve their team. The opinions of other league members about the involved players' values shouldn't matter, there is always risk in
                            any trade. So why do we have a 3 day window in which the league can vote to veto? This has been in place since league inception, but does it make sense?
                            The 3 day window can throw a wrench in the system, where accepted trades may not process until after a player has played and possibly been injured. That 
                            scenario makes Friday-Sunday trades not likely to happen, and if the trade involves any Thursday games, it makes Tuesday-Sunday trades not likely.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The alternative is to allow the commissioner to push trades through as soon as they are agreed upon, or as soon as the commissioner can get to it. This
                            would allow trades to go through the same day so you can prepare for the week or make last minute moves up to game time. If, in the unlikely scenario
                            that the league has a serious qualm about the trade, the league may vote to undo it.

                            There may be times where a trade is very close to even, but one trade partner wants slightly more in return. Allowing trades to include FAB money could
                            help more trades go through, where a manager may be willing to give up a little more in FAB money to get the trade done.

                            The downside to this is that Yahoo doesn't have this included in their trade system, so it would have to be done manually. The trade partners would have 
                            to agree on the FAB money in a separate chat and the commissioner would have to make the changes manually in Yahoo.

                            In 2021, we voted to add punishment for the last place team, where they have to sit on a toilet during the draft and their team is named
                            by the defending champion (the loser also pays for the plaque to be added to the trophy). The toilet was a funny prop for the first draft 
                            or two, but it really lost its luster to where it had almost no effect in last year's draft.
